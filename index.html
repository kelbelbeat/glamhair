      <h3>Alex and Crystal</h3>
      <h3>Glam Team</h3>
      <h3>Hair and Makeup</h3>
      <h4> We attended Flair Beauty College in 2007/2008, graduated and became licensed in cosmetology. We worked together several times but went our separate ways working in salons and doing hair for weddings and special events. Years later, we were in our 20s, married and realized that we both love the bridal world and helping people get ready for their wedding day. We reunited in 2014 and decided that we were going to work together again to create a business that we were passionate about! With trial and error, we worked hard to narrow down our favorite professionals to contract out that also have a passion for this business and who keep their prices at an affordable rate. Since then we've been building up the business. We decided to provide mobility to cut down the stress and anxiety for Brides on their special day. We love the hustle and bustle of getting the Bride and her bridesmaids ready on time but we provide a relaxing yet upbeat atmosphere! Ultimately we want to provide a convenient and stress-free environment for our clients. We are always open to learning more and keeping up to date on the latest hair trends. In the last few years we decided to branch out into providing full service spa parties. We travel from Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley through the Santa Clarita Valley. Today we can confidently say that we've built a business in making women look and feel their best on any occasion! And we have fun doing it!

          <h3>Jasmin Figueroa </h3>
          <h3>Makeup Artist </h3>
          <h4>Hi there! My name is Jasmin Figueroa I am a self taught makeup artist with 10+ years in the beauty Industry. I worked my share in the retail world. Where I got the opportunity to work side by side with top pro MUA from brands like MAKE UP FOR EVER, Benefit, LORAC, Cargo and Nars just to name a few. I've had the privilege of meeting celebrity MUA Coral Shaw to Sam and Nic from Real Techniques. Being in retail also allowed me to test out 200+ cosmetic brands, so you can imagine my makeup kit. I've been a freelance MUA for 7 years. My favorite part about my job is definitely hearing my clients say "I love it!" I really do enjoy making people feel beautiful. That is why I specialize in bridal makeup. I take my time during my consultations. I answer all questions and I always give my professional opinion. I've worked with clients as young as age 8 to 87.
