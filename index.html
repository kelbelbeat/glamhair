      <h3>Alex and Crystal</h3>
      <h3>Glam Team</h3>
      <h3>Hair and Makeup</h3>
      <h4> We attended Flair Beauty College in 2007/2008, graduated and became licensed in cosmetology. We worked together several times but went our separate ways working in salons and doing hair for weddings and special events. Years later, we were in our 20s, married and realized that we both love the bridal world and helping people get ready for their wedding day. We reunited in 2014 and decided that we were going to work together again to create a business that we were passionate about! With trial and error, we worked hard to narrow down our favorite professionals to contract out that also have a passion for this business and who keep their prices at an affordable rate. Since then we've been building up the business. We decided to provide mobility to cut down the stress and anxiety for Brides on their special day. We love the hustle and bustle of getting the Bride and her bridesmaids ready on time but we provide a relaxing yet upbeat atmosphere! Ultimately we want to provide a convenient and stress-free environment for our clients. We are always open to learning more and keeping up to date on the latest hair trends. In the last few years we decided to branch out into providing full service spa parties. We travel from Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley through the Santa Clarita Valley. Today we can confidently say that we've built a business in making women look and feel their best on any occasion! And we have fun doing it!
